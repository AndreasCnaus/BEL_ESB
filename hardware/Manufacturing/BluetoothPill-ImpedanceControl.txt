   Impedance control required

 1) 50 Ohms (+-10%) Single-Ended Microstrip
    L1 (ref. L2)
    Trace width = 0.17mm
  
  2) 90 Ohms (+-10%) Defferential Microstrip (50 Ohms (+-10%) Single-Ended))
     L1 (ref. L2)
     Trace width = 0.17mm
     Trace spacing = 0.22mm

 Confirm trace widths and spacings. Adjust stack-up as necessary.
